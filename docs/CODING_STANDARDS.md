# Coding Standards

## 1. General Principles
- **Simplicity:** Code must be simple, concise, and readable. Avoid over-engineering.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep logic, data, and presentation separate.

## 2. Naming Conventions
- Variables/Functions: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## 3. Tech-Specific Rules
- [Add Framework Specific Rules Here, e.g., "Use functional components in React"]

## 4. Documentation Standards
- Use Docstrings for functions/classes.
- Comments should explain **why**, not **what**.
